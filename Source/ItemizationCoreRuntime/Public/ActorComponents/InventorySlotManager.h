 * Manages the slots of an inventory.
 * This component is meant to be used in conjunction with the InventoryManager component. 
 * Slots are purely virtual and don't have any physical representation.
 * Also, they don't store any items,
 * rather they contain the cached-off handle to the item which lives in the inventory.
 *
 * Slots are primarily used to manage and organize items in the inventory grid.
 * By default, slots aren't limited to any specific item type and have to be configured via the item traits.
 *
 * Having slots fits for many different inventory systems, for example, a grid-based inventory system.
